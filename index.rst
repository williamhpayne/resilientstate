Combining qualitative data with human insight, we help organisations navigate the intersection of public policy, societal shifts, and emerging technology.

We specialise in high stakes sectors including critical national infrastructure, defence, policing, and healthcare. 

Our approach goes beyond standard analysis. We employ advanced scenario planning — including Cross Impact Analysis and Field Anomaly Relaxation (FAR) — to model future risks and opportunities. 

`Our services include`_ : technology and societal futures forecasting, horizon scanning, public policy analysis, UK/EU procurement evaluation, and public sector `operational intelligence`_ .

Our objective: providing leaders with the intelligence required to act with confidence.

We have worked with: The UK Home Office, the FCDO, the NHS, major investment firms and technology vendors.
